# How code can help you fold clothes

I recently started looking into A.I and machine learning for a my own curiosity, but more so with the agenda to create a machine that folds your laundry. Lucky for me it already exists. Yay!

Folding laundry was never a favorite chore for me growing up and it still isn’t… the idea of a folding machine was already concept in cartoons, so I thought why don’t we have folding machines in our households or in commercial use? we already had machines that wash our clothes, why not have a machine to fold them to.

#### History of the idea come to life

There are two folding machines already in circulation, they are the “_Foldimate_” and the “_Laundroid_”. The Foldimate was founded by Gal Rozov, an Israeli software engineer who, in 2010, quit his job and spent two years developing his laundry-folding device. In 2012, he moved to the United States to work with a robotic team in Silicon Valley and in 2013 he patented his idea… the prototype was presented at CES 2017. Later, the company exhibited an updated prototype of Foldimate at CES 2018.

The Laundroid home robot, was first introduced and demonstrated at the 2015 CEATEC (Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies) consumer electronics show in Tokyo. It was jointly developed by Daiwa House, Panasonic, and Seven Dreamers.

#### How do they work?

> Laundroid uses multiple robotic arms to pick up the clothes, which are then scanned by cameras. It’s connected by Wi-Fi to a server that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the object, and a neural network containing 256,000 images of different clothing items. The robot arms then determine the best way to handle the clothing, where to hold it up by, and how it should be folded. -The Verge

*   Scanned by Cameras
*   Photo of object is sent to neural network server
*   Neural network then determines how to fold clothes
*   Neural network then sends instructions to a robot arm

#### How neural network make this a possibly?

> An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. -[Christos Stergiou and Dimitrios Siganos](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol4/cs11/report.html)

We can know start to think about how these folding machines are working under the hood. The process of folding clothes is very similar to the way we humans fold clothes; we take an article of clothing we receive information through our optic nerves(eyes), that information then gets passed to our prefrontal cortex, which processes the information, and then gives instruction to you motor sensory to move your arms in a way that will fold the clothes. The way the folding machine does this is using cameras to scan an article of clothing, send to it neural networks via wifi, and then send instructions to the robotic arms in the machine, on how to fold that particular piece of clothing.

Earlier versions of neural networks were shallow, usually one input and one output layer, and at most one hidden layer in between. _More than three layers (including input and output) qualifies as “deep” learning._ In deep-learning networks, each layer of nodes trains on a distinct set of features based on the previous layer’s output. The further you advance into the neural net, the more complex the features your nodes can recognize, since they aggregate and recombine features from the previous layer. Some of the neural networks that we might see implemented these machine are are bit more complex in structure since we require it to know the how fold a piece of clothing and maybe even remember preferences.

#### Conclusion

There much more that goes into the technical specs of a clothes folding machine, and these are just some of the basics… the code behind these machines are guarded but with enough research we can infer what sort of algorithms are being used to run a machine like these.
