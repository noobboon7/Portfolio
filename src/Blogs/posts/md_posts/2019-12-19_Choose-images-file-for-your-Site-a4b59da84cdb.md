Hello internet! Today I‚Äôm going to discuss images on a webpage and why svg are a great option for icons.

In my own mission to make my portfolio look more like the ones you see on awwwards.com. I set out to animate more of the element on my page, making it more fun to look at. However, in this blog I will not be covering animations, though it is very possible to animate with svg icons.

When creating your website or apps you with start to work with many different images, but how do you choose? When I choose I like to go for the high quality images, but that comes with a memory cost and will slow down the rendering speed of the page. I normally went with either jpeg or png, but I noticed, when I started working with svg‚Äôs, my sites render time was pretty fast. Below I have a list of pros and cons that can help you decide with choosing an images file for your website.

#### Portable Network Graphic¬†(PNG)

PNG

**Pros:**

*   minimum compression loss(the image quality is not changed by any compression ratio);
*   it supports multi level of transparency.
*   it‚Äôs possible to work with layers;
*   the ability to add to the file metadata;
*   small size files.

**Cons:**

*   doesn‚Äôt support animation;
*   not well-suited for working with full-color images;
*   can not store multiple images in one file;

One of the best use case I‚Äôve seen it being used in is as a logo.

#### **Joint Photographic Expert Group¬†(**JPEG)

JPEG

**Pros:**

*   JPEG format is extremely portable.
*   JPEG format is compatible with most of the hardware devices e.g printers etc.(just in case you want to print your siteüßê ü§î).
*   JPEG format can store high-resolution fast-moving images.
*   JPEG image can be compressed down to 5% of its original size.

**Cons:**

*   JPEG compression technique is a lossy compression.
*   Quality of Image is reduced after JPEG compression.
*   JPEG image format is not capable of handling animated graphic images.
*   JPEG images do not support layered images.
*   Only 8-bit images are supported by JPEG format.

#### Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG)

SVG

**Prosüòä:**

*   Small file sizes - SVG image elements take up much less space, so they are easier on your computer memory.
*   Flexibility - With CSS, you can change the graphics settings, for example background color, position of the logo, and animations.
*   Scalability - you can increase the size of the image on the web page without changing the image quality.
*   Inspectable - it‚Äôs possible to view the contents of the SVG file in any browser.

**Cons üòµ:**

*   If the object consists of a large number of small elements, then the properties on the svg then to grow pretty quickly¬†.
*   Unless you know svg really well, it‚Äôs attributes are harder to read and it slows you down.

#### Conclusion

I prefer to go with SVG over every other file, though the truth is: when make making a website you tend to use a mix of different image formats(usually 2 file formats for me). So now that you have a list of pros and cons go out there and experiment with different image formats; test the speed performance of you site.
