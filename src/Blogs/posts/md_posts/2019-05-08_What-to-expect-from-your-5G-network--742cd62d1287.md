Whoa! can you believe it the future of networking is here; the next-generation standard for wireless communications are set to start taking over the mobile network environment in 2019, with rollout already happening in south korea and the US.

#### What is 5G

5G is just short for fifth generation, usually referring to an advanced wirelessly network. All the 5G wireless devices communicate by radio waves with a local antenna and low power automated transceivers, which is a transmitter and a receiver in the cell. They communicate with frequency channels assigned by your phone’s transceiver, and the local antennas that are connected with the telephone network.

So what does this mean for you…

#### 5g specs

One of 5G’s main advantages is speed; with data transfer speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G (up to 20 gigabits per second) and latency under a millisecond( least in ideal conditions). Also, 5G can handle more users, with estimates up to a million devices in a single square kilometer; in “technical terms”, we are getting more bandwidth. This means less congestion on the network connection in a crowded area.

These new capabilities are possible due to 5G using ultra-high frequencies, mmWave technology, and spatial beamforming. Lower frequency bands cover much greater distances but have limited data speeds. However, high-frequency bands can only cover smaller areas but can send and receive much more data.

#### Benefits

*   Better city tech infrastructure (increased public safety, traffic flow, etc.)
*   Better Smart car navigations
*   Better VR and AR tech connectivity
*   Greater speed(enough to download a movie in few seconds(Not in the US))
*   Greater capacity(1,000 times capacity of 4G)
*   Reduced Latency(stop delays)
*   Provide high resolution and larger bandwidth
*   Lower battery consumption
*   Simultaneous connections can work together

#### Conclusion

5G is an awesome upgrade for our network connectivity, but we won’t be experiencing it to its fullest capacity until the infrastructure it set in place. Also, check out this really cool video below, about what is to come with 5G.
