Alright! We are up to the last section of my css journey, where I‚Äôm going to cover css grid. In my last blogs I went over some key concepts in [flexbox](https://medium.com/@jvr572/flexbox-cheatsheet-3926837589ee), [sass](https://medium.com/@jvr572/get-sass-5b9b9a7c74f6) and [css architecture](https://medium.com/@jvr572/how-to-structure-css-8c5572228d4d). All of these concepts are interchangeable and in fact work pretty well together. So, if there is some syntax that looks a bit strange, feel free to look at the previous articles mentioned above.

#### What is css¬†grid?

Css grid is yet another way to set the layout of your website; it uses 2 dimension (row axis ‚Üí and column axis ‚Üì) while in flexbox you use only 1 dimension.

**_Note:_** _you can use flexbox item within grid container but you cannot use grid inside of flexbox._

display: grid;

In this image you‚Äôll notice that there is a container and items placed in the container, set in 2-rows of 3-columns; however, by default, when writing `display: grid;` all of the your HTML items are going to be in a rows, taking up all available space in the view-width of said container.

#### Syntax

Below you‚Äôll find some of the most used syntax to make a nice css grid layout:

// use on container manipulation 

grid-template-rows

grid-template-columns     //or grid-template

grid-template-areas  
\=============================================

grid-row-gap                 
                         //or grid-gap  
grid-column-gap

\=============================================

justify-items           align-items

justify-content         align-content  
\==============================================

grid-auto-rows          grid-auto-columns

             grid-auto-flow  
\==============================================

// to manipulate items 

grid-row-start  
                    {abstraction} grid-row          
grid-row-end

                                             {abstraction}grid-area 

grid-column-start  
                    {abstraction} grid-column  
grid-column-end  
\==============================================

justify-self

align-self  
\==============================================

order {used to place items}

I found these css properties to be the most helpful when coding out a new layout, and for the most part you‚Äôll be using these the most.

#### Conclusion

I‚Äôve been using grid for a couple of days now and the experience is pretty amazing compared to the float model. There is a small learning curve to this technology, but I will only take a few minutes to get how the syntax works. The thought process of creating layouts has change but the styling of the page will yield similar results to older css layout models.

Css grid is an powerful tool to create layouts for yourself or clients alike, and a browser that enhances your ability to see the layout is firefox; I would recommend it over other browsers because the developer tools work well for grid. That's all folks! I really enjoyed learning more about css and learning how the design of webpages are made. stay tuned for other technologies that I will be exploring.üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
