In this article I going over understanding NoSQL, because to be completely honest I did not know what NoSQL was until I sought out mongoDB(which is fairly recent).

I‚Äôve heard about NoSQL before, but honestly I didn‚Äôt think about looking into the tech, because I was so used to using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. Didn‚Äôt see much of a reason to look into another database model(also a newer concept for me which I will go over); Building apps with rails ActiveRecord magic(a ruby gem), really made setting up schema tables feel effortless. But I‚Äôm told mongoDB will open me to a whole new world‚Ä¶

#### Brief on¬†MongoDB

> **MongoDB** is a [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform") [document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database "Document-oriented database") program. Classified as a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL "NoSQL") database program, MongoDB uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON")\-like documents with [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema "Database schema"). MongoDB is developed by [MongoDB Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB_Inc. "MongoDB Inc.") and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwikipedia

Hmm, a quick google search on mongoDB lead me to the definition above, but if(!familiarNoSQL) {return ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confusion‚Äù}. So, in order to clear up some confusion about how mongoDB uses no SQL, am going to try and help us understand what noSQL is.

#### NoSQL DB

So traditional SQL databases or relational database management systems(RDBMS), are used to store data with a ACID model, but with NoSQL we use a BASE model.

ACID is an acronym for **atomicity, consistency, isolation,** and **durability;** I like think about this concept using the traditional image of an excel spreadsheet. So, in layman's term, it‚Äôs a very rigorous data structure that only understand a formal SQL language.eh.

The BASE data model is an acronym for **Basic Availability, Soft State,** and **Eventual Consistency.** This model accommodates flexibility when creating data of objects, though isn‚Äôt saved directly to table, but at some point in time these unstructured data points turn into a readable form of JSON.yay!

Pro: In the unlikely event that a failure disrupts access to a segment of data, this does not necessarily result in a complete database outage.üçÄ

Con: Data consistency is the developer‚Äôs problem and should not be handled by the database. üòµ

#### Conclusion

there is so much more I want to talk about when I come to this topic like how it help with big data issues and how we can use them in our application. But for now I think understanding what noSQL is on a basic level is a good start. I‚Äôve gone in a article rabbit hole searching explanations and gain a some useful concept to understand and I‚Äôve linked some of those below(though they tend to repeat some ideas. In the coming weeks I definitely am going to see how I can implement mongoDB in my projects.

Thanks to the peeps at FreeCodeCamp.org for putting up great content, I‚Äôve definitely gained a valuable skill with mongoDB.
