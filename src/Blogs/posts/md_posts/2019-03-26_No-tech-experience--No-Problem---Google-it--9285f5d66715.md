# No tech experience. No Problem. Google it!

When I first starting to learning code, I thought my head was going to explode, and immediately I thought “only computer geniuses could do this kind of work!?”

I hadn’t even started my started my immersive bootcamp yet, and I was ready to quit! Until, I remembered what my friends from the Dev community told me about their troubleshooting process, “if you don’t know what to do, just GOOGLE IT!. . . you’ll soon realize how important google is going to be in your career as a developer”. I was a bit shocked to hear google’ing was all I had to do, in order to become a savvy developer. Although, google is a very helpful tool for questions like the what is the like today weather? or how is my commute?; I did not bother to think that this was a source of truth for coding queries. However, google may not always give you exactly what you are looking for, but you can alway come pretty close to an answer. So, how do you narrow down you searches and cut down search time so you can get more coding done?

### Keywords

Instead of using whole phrases, use keywords that are specific to the topic you are trying to inquire about. For instance, if you wanted to look up how to use methods in ruby or even find out which ones you have available at your disposal. I would type in to the search bar “Methods ruby”, and presto! the results…

super fast, it only took 0.53 seconds to find the resources that are going to be essential when writing my code… now that I have a list of the methods that I can use, it’s time to decide which ones will best suit the application I’m trying to write. But what if I still need to clarify how to use my method that I found seconds ago.

Again, Google it! Hooray! I was able to find the method “.map” with the keywords “.Map ruby”. Wow! The use of keywords has really saved us some time; I think I’ll spend more time working on some code. I know this seem pretty simple (and it is) but it works 90% of the time, the other 10% is looking through other coding resources like stack\_overflow, reddit, etc. though, sure enough, if you google’d a query about code you’d find those other aforementioned resources as you scroll through the results.

There are so many ways to narrow a search if you really wanted to, and if you want to find even better ways to use google to its full potential, check this video out below.

### Conclusion

Google is not just only a cool search engine, where you can find the latest updates on your favorite TV show’s, but its also a very powerful tools for seasoned developers to find answers.
