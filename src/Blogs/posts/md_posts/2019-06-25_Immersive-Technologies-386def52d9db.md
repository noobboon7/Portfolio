#### **Intro**

If you’re gamer of sorts, then you might already familiar with what immersive tech is, and if you are not familiar, you can think about it in three main categories: Augmented Reality(AR), Virtual Reality(VR), and Mixed Reality(MR). Immersive tech can be defined as an emulation of our physical world that extends reality or creates a new reality by leveraging the 360 space in a digital form.

### Types of immersion

#### Augmented reality

This type of immersion is based on real world interaction, where computer-generated objects are placed in the medium you are interacting with. Take your phone for example… when you are using a photo filter or playing games like pokemon go! you are experiencing AR technology: Your camera is taking in your objective reality processing through a rendering engine, sends data over to a server, which then send back an object that would make sense in the picture, and finally renders a digital image(all in real-time).whao!

> The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital world blend into a person’s perception of the real world, not as a simple display of data, but through the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as natural parts of an environment.

#### Virtual reality

> **Virtual reality** (**VR**) is an experience taking place within simulated and immersive environments that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. -Wikipedia

How VR is tricking your eyes

Virtual Reality uses hardware (usually headsets) to simulate a digital world around you; VR, in a game setting, can have a bunch of different hardware working together in order to fully immerse you into the game. For instance, first person shooters will have a headset covering your eyes and ears to give you a visual and auditory perception, and if you really wanted to take it to the next level companies like [virtuix](https://www.virtuix.com/) have a treadmill like apparatus that simulates walking/running.

#### Mixed Reality

> As an independent concept, mixed reality combines the best of both virtual reality and augmented reality. When used to classify the larger scope of reality technologies, it refers to the coverage of all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects. -realitytechnologies.com

Different types of Immersive Tech

Mixed reality can be a bit confusing, so to clarify what it is, let's use the google glass as an example… Google glass were supposed to be a wearable technology that would be to augment your reality and be fully interactive. This meant that we would have been able to see digital objects projected in the real-world (like AR) and interact with the digital image (like VR).

#### List of Applications

I’ve only been talking about games so far but immersive technology can be use for multiple uses. Some of them include:

*   adult industry
*   art
*   entertainment
*   video game
*   interactive storytelling
*   military
*   education
*   medicine

#### Conclusion

Immersive technology is a multi-facet tool that can be used for multiple use; weather it's for your entertainment or to learn a new skill, immersive tech will help people gain new perspective through digital means.
