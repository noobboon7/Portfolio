What is sass?

#### **What is sass?**

> Sass(short for syntactically awesome style sheets)is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. -wikipedia

#### Preprocessing css

So the great thing about sass is that it precompiles css for you, and in essence you’ll be writing a lot less pure css code. This blog will explain how you will be able to use css syntax with some really cool features that come with SASS.

#### Variables

If you’ve been use css you’ll know that you can use variable with pure css too; however what changes is that way you write those variables

```
////scss syntax for writing variables /////$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;$primary-color: #333;
```

```
/////how they are implemented /////body {  font: 100% $font-stack;  color: $primary-color;}
```

//how they are translated to css ///  
`body {  
  **font**: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;  
  **color**: #333;  
}`

now here is without a preprocessor like Sass or Less.

:root {  
  --bgcolour: #ffffd0;  
  --bqindents: 40px;  
  --warningtextsize: 125%;  
}

#### Nesting

If you’ve probably already encountered nesting with HTML and you’ve noticed that it has a clear hierarchy. When writing pure css you have to write the parent element along with the child element that you want manipulate multiple times: not really giving you a good visual or good time writing it. With sass we have the option for nesting, take a look at the example below:

### SCSS SYNTAX

```
//Nesting in sass nav {  ul {    margin: 0;    padding: 0;    list-style: none;  }
```

```
  li { display: inline-block; }
```

```
  a {    display: block;    padding: 6px 12px;    text-decoration: none;  }}
```

/////results in pure css/////  
`nav ul {  
  **margin**: 0;  
  **padding**: 0;  
  **list-style**: none;  
}  
nav li {  
  **display**: inline-block;  
}  
nav a {  
  **display**: block;  
  **padding**: 6px 12px;  
  **text-decoration**: none;  
}`

#### Partials

> Partial Sass files contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like `_<filename>.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the `@use` rule. — sass-lang.com/guide

If you like reusable code then this particular feature will come in very handy.

```
// _base.scss$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;$primary-color: #333;body {  font: 100% $font-stack;  color: $primary-color;}
```

```
// styles.scss@use 'base';.inverse {  background-color: base.$primary-color;  color: white;}
```

#### Mix-ins

Mix-ins are a great tool for when you don’t want to write in to much of the same code and the great part about it is that you can feed it an augment to specify the parameters.

```
@mixin transform($property) {  -webkit-transform: $property;  -ms-transform: $property;  transform: $property;}.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
```

you’ll notice the @include is used, in order to invoke this mix-in.

#### Operators

Operations are pretty standard across the board, by this I mean +- () \* /; these all works like basic arithmetic operations.

```
.container {  width: 100%;}article[role="main"] {  float: left;  width: 600px / 960px * 100%;}aside[role="complementary"] {  float: right;  width: 300px / 960px * 100%;}
```

#### Conclusion

These are most of the features that you will use in sass, though their is another that I did not mention and thats extend/inheritance. If you’d like to know more about inheritance please do visit [https://sass-lang.com/guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide), they have a very comprehensive guide on sass.
